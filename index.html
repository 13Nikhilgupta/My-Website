      <h3>Programming and Development</h3>
      <p class="para">Since childhood I was curious about various things, especially I was very interested in technology and as I was growing up I also witnessed very drastic changes in technology. 
        So, I choose IT industry as my career. I learned some programming languages includes C/C++ , Python and Java and also some Web development tools which are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React. Currently I am learning about React Native.</p>

      <h3>Perfection</h3>
      <p class="para">Yes, Perfection is my skill. I always try to do things in the way it was meant to be. My this quality help me to think practically, Suppose there is some
        task which if done imperfectly it might cause any type of loss in future then I will try to find some alternative. Basically for me perfection is to do things which don't have negative impact on someone.
